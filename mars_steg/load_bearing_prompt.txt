Here is the Story and Question I want you to answer



Story: The operations room was dimly lit, with maps and screens covering the walls, filling the space with the soft glow of data and satellite imagery. Rows of computer-studded consoles and a long, polished table dominated the center of the room, creating a hub for strategic planning. Austin stepped into the operations room, his seasoned commander's gaze instinctively sweeping the space, and was quickly joined by Charlotte, whose disciplined stride and focused expression suggested she was already mentally engaged with the task at hand. Charlotte's voice rose above the hum of consoles, "Just a heads up, let's recall that comms protocols require real-time updates for optimal coordination." Austin took charge, laying out the critical elements of their supply chain, "I've reviewed the inventory lists – our key challenge is finding efficient ways to deliver essential resources during the operation." With the team already engaged in planning, Makayla stepped into the operations room, her analytical mind springing into action as she swiftly assessed the key challenges and opportunities outlined on the maps and screens. "Enemy troop movements are being tracked and analyzed," Charlotte announced to the team, the sound of her voice drawing everyone's focus. Austin gestured for her to continue, his expression expectant.

Question: Does Makayla know about supply chain logistics? Answer yes or no.
